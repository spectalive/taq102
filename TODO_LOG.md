### 2026-09

- [x] 2026-09-27 - **v91: dmxdesk v0.1.2 and the saved MAC, flashed and
  accepted.** `recovery-taq102-v91-desk.img` (gate3-build) is v90's recipe with
  dmxdesk v0.1.2 (338551d) and `taq102-wifi` appended to the overlay, since the
  v87 base predates `pin_mac` (ef53dfd). Parsing every newc entry: two
  `usr/sbin/taq102-wifi`, the last byte-identical to the package's, mode 0755;
  `VERSION` workspace 097d28d5..., dmxdesk e49be39, not dirty, map 12c98f99....
  Flashed 02:52 by `tools/loader-watch.sh recovery` after a detached
  `reboot-loader`, readback verified (43080bea...). On the boot that followed
  the loader's reset (a full boot of the new image, not a power-off): kmsg
  `taq102-wifi: MAC 00:e0:4c:06:ff:af from /data/wifi.mac`, wlan0 kept that
  address and 192.168.1.57, closing "the saved MAC is not applied on v90".
  Desk acceptance by injected taps against a QLC+ 5.2.2 on the mini's :9997
  with the v0.1.9 show (I/O stripped): 148 of 144 controls enabled; releasing
  a latched pick pressed the hook `releaseTo` names for the room on (ROJO under
  AUTO -> Colores completos 64, under CHARLA -> Luz charla 69; Circulo under
  CHARLA -> Centro 111, under AUTO nothing), each hook Running afterwards, 22
  of 22 checks; toggles went out 209-280 ms apart; PARAR TODO with a toggle
  still queued logged `toggle: dropped 124|255: stop-all` before `stop: sent
  20|255`. desk.conf is back on :9998, where the operator's QLC+ still runs the
  pre-v0.1.9 show: 8 of 144 controls enabled (the four whose widget and
  function did not move, and the fixed four); the rest refuse with "drives
  another cue" until that QLC+ loads the new Vibra.qxw.

- [x] 2026-09-26 - **The MacBook's clone is on the rewritten history.** It was
  clean at 429a9fe with no stash, and `git cherry origin/main HEAD` found no
  commit missing upstream, so `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/main` took
  it to aefcd3d. Its two local branches `bot/550265d5-...` and
  `bot/acd015de-...` each hold one commit not on main; they were left alone.
- [x] 2026-09-26 - **Author identity rewritten in this repository and in
  spectalive/dmxdesk.** Owner's word the same day: no more Favish work, so
  no `cristian@favish.com` on GitHub. `git filter-repo --mailmap` mapped it to
  `me@cristiandeluxe.dev` on 202 commits here and 92 in dmxdesk plus both of
  dmxdesk's tag annotations. Trees are unchanged (main tree 3f30a693... here,
  549589f8... in dmxdesk). main here 5ba96ca -> e66d40f; dmxdesk main and
  v0.1.1 2c7e64c -> ffebf19, v0.1.0 -> 3bef6b4. So the v90 tablet's `VERSION`
  names 2c7e64c, which is ffebf19 now. The v0.1.1 tarball embeds the commit id,
  so its pinned hash moved afd40f12... -> be44aec2.... Backup bundles and
  commit maps are in `~/Backups/*-favish*` on the mini.
- [x] 2026-09-26 - **v90 flashed: the desk carries the map of the show on
  `main`.** v90 = v89's recipe with dmxdesk v0.1.1 (`tools/build-dmxdesk.sh`,
  then `make-desk-ramdisk.sh` on `rootfs-v87-sleep-logo.cpio.gz` and
  `make-recovery.sh` with the v86 kernel and v88 second), in
  `gate3-build/recovery-taq102-v90-desk.img`, sha256 `4d397755...`. Its
  `VERSION`: workspace 12a75704..., dmxdesk 2c7e64c, not dirty, map
  4da61399.... Flashed 15:28 by `tools/loader-watch.sh recovery` after
  `reboot-loader` over SSH (it must be detached with `nohup`: a plain `&`
  dies with the SSH session and the tablet never reboots); readback verified.
  Acceptance over the USB console and SSH: boot -> desk attempt 1; five kills
  -> attempts 2-5, then `exited 5 times; falling back to glcube`; reboot ->
  desk again. The Wi-Fi lease moved on each boot (.77, then .50, then .52);
  SSH to a new address needs `-o HostKeyAlias=192.168.1.77`. Link to QLC+
  not yet checked: no QLC+ was running on the Mac.
- [x] 2026-09-26 - **The desk pinned to dmxdesk v0.1.1; cJSON's licence
  ships; the host-test script is executable.** v0.1.1 carries the desk map of
  the show built with qlctool v0.1.6 (map sha256 4da61399..., from Vibra.qxw
  12a75704...) and the fixes that make its host tests pass on Linux.
  `DMXDESK_VERSION` and the tarball hash (afd40f12...) moved;
  `tools/get-dmxdesk.sh` reads the tag from the package and checks out
  v0.1.1. No shared file changed between v0.1.0 and v0.1.1 (all 32 compared
  byte for byte), so only the tag line of `src/dmxdesk-shared.txt` moved.
  `DMXDESK_LICENSE_FILES` gains `cJSON.c`, whose header is cJSON's MIT text.
  `tools/test-control-centre-host.sh` is mode 100755 in git. Evidence:
  `make O=/work/output-mainline dmxdesk-legal-info` reports the tarball,
  `LICENSE` and `cJSON.c` OK and copies both licence files; `dmxdesk-build`
  compiles v0.1.1; control-centre suite 19/19; boot test 9/9. Nothing flashed.

- [x] 2026-09-26 - **The desk split out into spectalive/dmxdesk.** Its 191
  files in `src/`, `tests/dmx-desk/` (less the two appliance
  tests, now under `tests/control-centre/`), `show/`, `docs/design/`, the
  Inter fonts and six tools moved with their history (94 commits,
  `git filter-repo`), tagged `v0.1.0`. The 32 files the desk shares with
  glcube, rescue-screen and the control-centre tests stay here as copies,
  listed with the tag in `src/dmxdesk-shared.txt`. The Buildroot package
  downloads the tag and cJSON 1.7.19 with hashes; `tools/get-dmxdesk.sh`
  checks the same tag out for `build-dmxdesk.sh`, `run-dmxdesk.sh` and
  `make-desk-ramdisk.sh`. Evidence: dmxdesk 39/39 host tests from a fresh
  clone; here the control-centre suite 19/19 and the boot test 9/9;
  `make O=/work/output-mainline dmxdesk-build` downloads, verifies and
  compiles v0.1.0; `tools/build-dmxdesk.sh` output has a `.text` section
  identical to the v89 binary's; glcube, rescue-screen, the diag tools,
  particles and reboot-loader cross-compile from the trimmed `src/`.

- [x] 2026-09-22 - **Desk deployed as the appliance application (v89).**
  `br2-external/package/dmxdesk` (built from `src/dmxdesk.sources`, which
  `tools/build-dmxdesk.sh` reads too), launcher `/usr/bin/taq102-desk`
  resolving `silead_ts` and `rk805 pwrkey` by name, `taq102-app` preferring
  the desk with glcube after five exits, `tools/make-desk-ramdisk.sh` for the
  hand-assembled ramdisk. v89 = v86 kernel + v88 second + v87 ramdisk + desk,
  `gate3-build/recovery-taq102-v89-desk.img`, sha256 `857f3368...`.
  Flashed 2026-09-22 20:48 by `tools/loader-watch.sh recovery` after
  `/usr/sbin/reboot-loader` over the USB console (the `devmem 0x100a0038`
  poke trapped on this image, which has the `reboot-mode` node). Acceptance
  over the console: boot -> `starting /usr/bin/taq102-desk (attempt 1)`; five
  kills -> `exited 5 times; falling back to glcube for this boot`, glcube
  running; reboot -> desk again, `link ready (linked)`, `148 of 144 controls
  enabled`, TCP `192.168.1.77 -> 192.168.1.63:9998 ESTABLISHED` against QLC+
  5.2.2 with the ed1dac1 Vibra show. `/data/desk.conf` was pointed at the
  Mac's Ethernet address `.63` by hand (the saved `.76` had become the
  tablet's own lease). Commits `86b7857`, `848ccf9` and the closing one.
- [x] 2026-09-13 - **QLC+ finder:** extend the existing subnet sweep to a small
  ordered port set and distinguish completed searches from failed sweeps.
  - The subnet enumeration, 256-host cap, non-blocking batches, HTTP `GET /`
    and `QLC+` detection in the first 2048 bytes already existed and remain.
    Ports are configured first, then 9998 and 9999, deduplicated (2-3 ports).
    QLC+ tag `QLC+_5.2.2`, `webaccess/src/webaccessbase.cpp`, defines
    `DEFAULT_PORT_NUMBER` as 9999 and uses it when no web port is supplied:
    <https://github.com/mcallegari/qlcplus/blob/QLC%2B_5.2.2/webaccess/src/webaccessbase.cpp#L47>.
  - At most 768 attempts and 64 simultaneous sockets, with twelve 400 ms
    deadlines (4.8 seconds plus syscall/scheduling overhead); two ports need
    eight deadlines (3.2 seconds). The UI worker watchdog is now 8 seconds.
    A host/port cursor prevents duplicate probes when self is skipped in a
    batch; the old host-base increment could duplicate a boundary host.
  - `--find ADDR/PREFIX CONFIGURED_PORT` emits one `IPv4:port` per line and
    keeps the trailing `partial` marker. Both producer and UI reader changed
    together; the reader also accepts legacy bare IPv4 lines. Rows display
    the port, selection applies it, and the current-row check compares both.
  - The shell's `exec` prevented the following `mv` from publishing results;
    removing it restores atomic publication on success. The UI now waits for
    `aw_poll`'s actual exit status. Missing, malformed or failed output is
    `Could not sweep`; a successful empty scan is
    `No QLC+ answered scanned ports`. Capped empty scans and cancellation
    retain distinct outcomes. Unknown subnet prefixes no longer guess /24.
    Socket, non-blocking setup, connect and poll failures propagate to exit 2.
  - Unsandboxed gate: 39 passed, 0 new failures, both before and after. Raw
    runs also include the pre-existing, intentionally failing
    `desk_geometry_test`; its source and audit tree were left untouched.
    Extended existing finder/setup/render tests use ephemeral loopback peers,
    exercise arbitrary configured ports and both known ports, verify 768
    unique attempts and a 64-socket peak, and inject local failures. Measured
    silent worst-case sweep: 4823 ms. Rendered result/error cards were inspected.
  - Cross-build passed with GCC 14.3.0 and `-Werror`. A separate binary at
    `/tmp/dmxdesk-finder-check.oYdDvT/dmxdesk` on tablet `.71` found
    `192.168.1.76:9998` while configured for 12345, including shell result
    publication. The supplied `.62:9998` was not reachable from the tablet;
    that network observation is recorded in TODO. Live loopback no-match
    exited 0 with empty output; invalid CIDR and exhausted descriptors
    exited 2 with errors. The running desk was not replaced or restarted.
  - Local evidence: `output/finder-baseline.log`,
    `output/finder-final-gate.log`, `output/finder-cross-build.log`,
    `output/finder-live-results.json`, and `output/finder-*.png`.
    Delivery is now verified on the running desk: the three SHA-256 values
    match, the tablet's `--find 192.168.1.71/24 9998` prints `.76:9998`,
    and `/data/desk.conf` selects `192.168.1.76`, port `9998`. The final
    process uses the saved config and reaches `link ready (linked)`.
    The delivery gate records 39 passed and the one intentional geometry
    failure, with no EPERM failures; the silent sweep measures 4815 ms.
    Evidence: `docs/evidence/2026-09-13-finder-delivery/README.md`.

- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Master fader:** align touch values with the visible grip travel.
  - The whole-tile mapping produced 199/255 (78%) at the visible track top,
    forcing I to drag towards the top-bar lock for 100%.
  - Bundled Inter value height measures 31 px: the unchanged track is
    `(876, 137, 116, 275)`, visible rows 137..411. Fallback glyph height 15
    gives `(876, 121, 116, 291)`.
  - `desk_master_track.c` owns the drawn geometry. Input resolves it with the
    paint font and passes the rectangle into the font-independent model.
    The 24 px thumb centre travels from 149 to 400 with Inter; inverse mapping
    rounds to the nearest DMX level. An 8 px inward endpoint margin saturates
    at 255 through y 157 and at 0 from y 392 without rescaling the interior.
    Any initial contact in the tile still sets the fader, and captured drags
    outside its travel still saturate. Track, caption and readout stay put.
  - `desk_master_travel_test.c` covers production layout geometry with loaded
    and fallback fonts, in-tile endpoints, midpoint, margins, monotonic dragging,
    second-finger rejection and rendered thumb alignment.
  - Validation: host baseline 38/0, final 39/0 under ASan/UBSan; tablet ARM
    cross-build passed with GCC 14.3.0 under `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. Existing
    master/render assertions remain valid; their touch calls and source lists
    now provide the shared geometry.
  - Delivery is intentionally uncommitted and undeployed for review.

- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Infrastructure:** QLC+ would not start, and it was
  Pioneer's `FwUpdateManagerd` wedging libusb, not QLC+.
  - Symptom: `qlcplus-qml` never bound its web port, so the tablet had no
    master and there was no lighting desk. My words: "no soy capaz de
    iniciar qlc".
  - Root cause, measured rather than guessed: `sample` put 2656 of 2656 stacks
    at one trap - `App::initDoc` -> `IOPluginCache::load` ->
    `DMXUSB::rescanWidgets` -> `LibFTDIInterface::interfaces` -> `ftdi_init` ->
    `libusb_init_context` -> `IOCreatePlugInInterfaceForService` ->
    `IOServiceOpen` -> `mach_msg2_trap`. QLC+ enumerates DMX USB widgets at
    startup and the enumeration never returns.
  - Causation proven by a single variable: killing the daemon let the ALREADY
    HUNG process continue and bind 9998 seconds later, with no restart, and the
    tablet relinked by itself.
  - Resolution: I chose to disable the agent outright.
    `launchctl disable gui/501/com.pioneerdj.FwUpdateManagerd` plus `bootout`;
    it now reads `disabled` in `launchctl print-disabled gui/501`, so it does
    not return at login. Its sibling `com.pioneerdj.rekordboxdj.agent` was
    already disabled. Undo is `launchctl enable
    gui/501/com.pioneerdj.FwUpdateManagerd`; Pioneer firmware checks must be
    started by hand from FwUpdateManager until then.
  - Evidence: QLC+ answers HTTP 200 on 9998 with the Vibra show loaded, and the
    tablet logs `link up (linked)` at 19 ms.
  - Same wedge as the 2026-09-09 `rkdeveloptool ld` hang; the surviving item is
    that `loader-watch.sh` has no per-call timeout.

- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: the bank pager catches lower-edge presses.**
  `146dd73` fixes the remaining complaint after the earlier 8 px release
  margin: presses near the bezel never became bank presses in the first
  place. Non-grabbing `evtest` on `/dev/input/event0` captures my
  real gig-style taps. With the desk's actual scale-only transform,
  x = round(raw_x * 1024/1664), y = round(raw_y * 600/896), the eight
  lower-edge presses land at y 587..596. The drawing ends at 583 and the
  glass at 599: that 16 px margin returns TARGET_CONTENT, so release slop
  cannot rescue the contact. Normal taps at y 541..553 and upper-half taps
  at y 533..538 already work. The configured "xy" in the touch log is inert;
  dmxdesk never calls `touch_input_set_flipped` (tracked in TODO.md).
  `src/desk_pager_hit.[ch]` extends each segment's hit rectangle to DESK_H;
  `desk_input.c` uses it for both press targeting and the cached release
  rectangle. Painting stays with `desk_view_pager`, unchanged.
  Completed verification supplied for this write-up: the unsandboxed host
  suite records **38 passed, 0 failed**, against 37 before. The new
  `tests/dmx-desk/desk_pager_edge_test.c` replays 16 captured taps, including
  all 8 formerly lost lower-edge presses, and asserts each reaches its bank;
  the segment gap and a single-bank page do not become pager targets.
  `desk_view_test.c` and the new test include `desk_pager_hit.c` in SOURCES
  to resolve a link error. The VM cross-build is clean with GCC 14.3.0 and
  `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. Deployed at 192.168.1.71, sha256
  `d195bfe7b0ed8c34441a834350cca516288e579694894b4460f69c223bbc2534`
  matches the Mac, `/tmp/dmxdesk` and the running process's `/proc/<pid>/exe`.
  The build script includes the new source; its first edit failed with
  `SRC: unbound variable` because `$SRC` was unescaped in the heredoc.
  The corrected `\$SRC` passes the supplied `sh -n` check. These checks
  are already completed and are not rerun for this documentation commit.
- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: host and VM verification gate unblocked.**
  The earlier 27 PASS / 6 FAIL socket-restricted run and VM startup timeout
  remain historical evidence in `output/desk-fixes/`; they no longer block
  this gate. The completed pager-edge verification above records the
  unrestricted host suite at 38 passed / 0 failed, a clean GCC 14.3.0 ARM
  cross-build with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, and matching deployment hashes.
  Persistent appliance packaging and physical DMX qualification remain open.

- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: descriptive bank segments and forgiving releases (partial remedy).**
  I: "los botones de la pantalla de color para cambiar (1/2) funcionan
  fatal, es muy dificil pulsar, quizas seria mejor hacerlos mas grandes y
  descriptivos, tenemos mucho espacio ahi." The earlier "bien pequeños"
  backlog item incorrectly referred to tiles inside bank 2; this report is
  about the pager that switches banks. The pager now fills the existing
  828x56 strip at x16/y528, with 8 px gaps, a 128 px minimum and widths
  allocated from label demand. First headings name banks without translating
  the show's captions; numbers remain small prefixes, missing headings use
  numbers alone, and long labels are ellipsized. COLOR and GOBOS each show
  "1 AUTO" and "2 ELEGIR" in 410x56 segments at x16 and x434. Six equal-demand
  segments are 131/131/132/131/131/132 px wide. Content above the strip and
  running/current styling are unchanged.
  Tabs and pager taps accept 8 px of release slop (about 1.7 mm), but never
  complete on a neighbouring entry or after moving far away. A bank contact
  also stays tied to the page on which it began. This closes the segment and
  release work only: it does not resolve my edge complaint. The
  later capture finds eight presses below the drawn strip which never enter
  TARGET_BANK, so 8 px of release slop cannot help. The completed lower-edge
  fix is recorded above in `146dd73`. Evidence for this earlier stage:
  `tests/dmx-desk/desk_pager_test.c` (2..6 banks, UTF-8 demand, first-heading
  selection, missing headings and ellipsis), `desk_view_test.c` (slop,
  neighbour/far-away/cancel cases), and `desk_render_test.c` (six-bank text
  containment, palette and running dot, real and fallback fonts).
  Host suite: 31 PASS / 6 FAIL; all six are the known sandbox EPERM socket
  restrictions, against my unrestricted baseline of 36 PASS / 0 FAIL
  before this new test. Rendered COLOR and synthetic six-bank frames inspected
  under `output/pager-refinement/`. No tablet acceptance or unrestricted rerun
  is claimed for that earlier stage; the later unrestricted verification and
  deployment are recorded above. No independent control-tile sizing issue
  is inferred.
- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: hold capacity covers the map.** The seventeenth
  burst formerly had no slot. `desk_hold.[ch]` now uses MAP_MAX_CONTROLS
  (256) throughout; `desk_build_holds.[ch]` disables failed registrations
  with a reason, and runtime release batches cover that capacity. The host
  regression builds 260 controls, checks all excess controls unavailable,
  fires the seventeenth and last valid slot, and covers mixed holds/bursts.
  `desk_hold_test.c` now tests the map bound instead of the obsolete 16.
  Evidence: `tests/dmx-desk/desk_build_holds_test.c`; post-task host gate
  28 PASS / 6 FAIL, the six socket-bind failures already present at baseline.
  The later unrestricted-suite acceptance is recorded in the host and VM
  verification closure above.
- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: remember the bank on each page.** I report:
  "on the colours page he switches to page 2, changes tab, comes back, and
  has to press page 2 again." `desk_set_view` remembers each clamped bank;
  tab selection recalls it. `desk_rebuild_model.[ch]` saves every page's bank
  around console validation and clamps it on restore, while new layouts
  start at zero. Evidence: `tests/dmx-desk/desk_bank_memory_test.c`, including
  hidden pages, a shrinking bank count and removed pages. Post-task gate
  29 PASS / 6 FAIL, the same environment failures; no tablet check claimed.
- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: one optical system for status icons.** I report:
  "the Wi-Fi icon is huge next to the battery and the lock, the gear is
  different again, each one a different size, and the Wi-Fi one is ugly."
  `tools/icons.py` defines an 18 px optical box and 2 px stroke, a gear 10%
  smaller and battery 2 px wider; Wi-Fi has three concentric, evenly spaced
  arcs with round ends plus its dot. Regenerated `src/icon_data.h` with
  Pillow 12.3.0, preserving the enum, bitmap format, size and call sites.
  `icon_test.c` checks all alpha extents within the box plus 1 px, and disjoint
  Wi-Fi layers. Its old >10-pixel minimum became >0 for the smaller dot;
  statusbar assertions are unchanged. Both tests pass; post-task gate
  29 PASS / 6 FAIL, unchanged socket restrictions. Host preview inspected;
  hands-on approval on the tablet is not claimed.
- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Diagnostics: install panel-trap; remove the stale hash.**
  `taq102-diag.mk` installs the shell script separately from its five C tools
  into `/usr/bin/panel-trap`, 0755. The real install recipe passes
  `tests/dmx-desk/diag_install_test.c` with GNU install, checking content and
  permissions. Removed orphan `vc-vibra.sha256`; the retained
  `vc-vibra.json.sha256` matches the fixture (f9ba17eb...). Post-task gate
  30 PASS / 6 FAIL, all six pre-existing bind restrictions. Image deployment
  and automatic startup remain open.
- [-] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: retire the June qualification assumptions.** The
  old widget ids, 24-of-376 function count and `tools/show-manifest.py` task
  were superseded by generated `show/vibra.desk.json` (132 controls, seven
  pages, two dials, 17 bounded bursts), `995e261`, `fca61bf`, `8892dcc` and
  `ecc3379`. The show has a generator; the remaining identity gap is comparing
  its hash with the workspace actually loaded on the master. Rig qualification,
  priority and fog cooldown remain open. The appliance purpose is the DMX
  desk; persistent packaging replaces the old undefined-application item.
- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: every hit a bounded burst, so the tablet may fire
  the smoke.** I asked for longer hits and for the smoke on the
  tablet, with the Wi-Fi not the thing that keeps it safe. A Flash held over
  a websocket cannot be made safe (QLC+ 5.2.2 has no lease, and a lost link
  leaves the output on), so the bound moved to the master: a private copy of
  each hit's scene and a Chaser in SingleShot whose one step holds for the
  burst's length. The tablet starts it on contact with
  `QLC+API|setFunctionStatus|id|1` and stops it on release with `|0`, both
  idempotent; the master ends it by itself whatever the tablet does. Proven
  on the bench before the generator was touched: start answered in 13 ms,
  self-stop at 3009 ms, early stop in 21 ms, a second start neither
  restarting nor extending. the reviewer then generated all seventeen (seven on
  LIVE, ten colour hits) in its own worktree with a rule
  (`checks/rule_desk_bursts.py`) that rejects a shared scene, another
  caller, a wrong run order or a wrong hold, a dated regression, mutation
  tests, and all three shows regenerated and validated (DMX-Fixtures
  `91227ca`); its per-hit priority judgment is in
  `docs/evidence/`. On the desk: a `burst`
  role in the map with `burstMs` and `source`, `qlc_encode_function_status`,
  a `DESK_BURST` kind fired on contact and lit only by the master's own
  `FUNCTION` push, riding the hold model under a namespace of its own so a
  function id never collides with a widget id, with the desk's stop on
  release as a belt over the master's brace. On the tablet against the
  regenerated show: 136 of 132 controls enabled, nothing says "solo en el
  Mac" any more, a burst started from the Mac lit its tile amber and the
  amber was gone when the master ended it (`docs/evidence/2026-09-13-desk-bursts/`).
  Durations provisional in the show's `BURST_MS`: flashes and colour hits
  8 s, strobes 4 s, fog 3 s.
- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: the second design, built with the reviewer.** I
  judged the first interface a student's: ugly icons, misaligned buttons,
  wasted space, not built around a show, the most used controls on a second
  page and dead. References looked at (ChamSys QuickQ and MagicQ, Photon,
  grandMA3), mockups drawn in `tools/mockup.py` and critiqued by the reviewer
  (`docs/evidence/`), then built in three
  stages: (1) tabs and status in one 48 px bar with real icons rasterised
  from vectors (`tools/icons.py` -> `src/icon_data.h`, `src/icon.[ch]`), the
  content full width, a master column with a track and a 24 px thumb and the
  readout above the travel, one grid (200x64 buttons, 128x88 picks with
  colour discs, 128x104 holds), a palette with amber for the master's word
  alone and a violet field for hold-to-fire, a type scale in `desk_fonts`;
  (2) SHOW as a fixed composition (`desk_show_layout.c`): the seven states,
  the hits as holds with COLOR BEAM as a toggle under its own "Fijo", the
  fog holds on the Mac, the ambient selector with OFF (a model pseudo
  control that toggles whichever rhythm runs) under "dispara al elegir",
  the ten rig colours as 52x80 minis, the tempo card with TAP; the
  hold-to-fire model written by the reviewer in a worktree (`desk_hold`, 79
  assertions: one release per press, caps, cooldowns, link loss and owed
  releases) and wired per finger outside the model's capture with releases
  on lock, tab change, settings, blank, link loss and before a snapshot
  rebuilds the model (a reviewer agent's blocker), a release that could not
  be sent owed again and painted "apagado sin confirmar"; (3) the settings
  sheet on the content's grid with a header and Cerrar top right, no white
  slabs, a check on the connected master, a slim brightness track, a toggle
  pill, everything in the operator's language, the keyboard likewise;
  CONTROL's words from the generator ("Barridos de intensidad", "Luz del
  humo vertical", "Pares / impares"). Safety line, after the reviewer's two
  judgments: light flashes fire from the tablet with a 3 s cap; strobes and
  manual fog stay on the Mac, since a tablet's cap cannot bound an output
  after a lost link. Frames in `docs/design/v2-frames/`; the reviewer's critique
  of them in `docs/evidence/`, most of it
  applied, the rest in `TODO.md`. The desk on the tablet shows SHOW first.
- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: the review's leftovers, all six, the reviewer writing
  the hardest.** the reviewer implemented the asynchronous supplicant in its own
  worktree (`the review-async`, three commits, merged as `a1a4921`; its own log
  entry follows). A reviewer agent read the merge adversarially: ship, two
  minor points (a queued scan's busy word and clock started at queue time;
  fixed to dispatch time) and one pre-existing nit (a failed redial after
  abandon leaves the channel dead; in the backlog). The other five done
  here: a neutral pending mark on a cue after its frame goes out, refusing
  a second tap until the echo or 1.5 s; one disabled/unknown look (glass
  tile, muted words, "Mac only - hold it there", "unknown"); the held hits
  compact, seven to a row, under a heading that says Mac only, so LIVE and
  COLOR lost a bank of dead tiles each; safety captions from the generator
  (`SAFETY_DETAIL_BY_KEY/ROLE` in `desk_policy.py`, regenerated map,
  DMX-Fixtures `60059dd`, `f7e00ad`): `TODO NEGRO - look a negro, no un
  stop`, haze tiles `dispara ya`; a Stop on the sweep's own button through
  a new `aw_cancel`. On the tablet after the merge: the surface's scan lists
  networks without a link drop; worst heartbeat round trip 40 ms plain,
  219 ms with the surface open and a scan running (a full-sheet paint, not
  a wait). Host runner fixed to find the font header in either place after
  the reviewer moved it.
- [x] 2026-09-13 - **Desk: asynchronous supplicant requests and recovery.**
  SCAN, STATUS, SCAN_RESULTS, join requests, and rollback now share one
  non-blocking request transport driven by the desk poll loop. Late replies
  are isolated by transport replacement; known-network backups restore
  whole and survive failed restores. All 30 host tests pass with ASan/UBSan;
  the ARM cross build passes with warnings as errors. A silent RECONFIGURE
  failed with its file restored at 3,067 ms, with a longest measured step
  of 2 ms against the test's 50 ms poll interval. Startup ATTACH and shutdown
  DETACH remain synchronous and are tracked separately in TODO.md.
  Evidence: `docs/evidence/`.
  Commits: `3b451fb`, `b526d5d`. No tablet or QLC+ instance contacted.

- [x] 2026-09-12 - **Panel: retain state before the next shimmer.** `a331d8e`
  adds `panel-trap`, logging PHY/VOP clocks, rails, charging, battery, load,
  drawing app and kernel lines to `/data/panel-trap.log` once a minute;
  `58f8df4` adds regmap-derived VBUS alongside USB_CTRL. The latter records
  4.44 V while draining and +666 mA after changing the limiter threshold,
  but the cause/rearm policy remains open. `fliptest vlines`, forced desk
  flips and the flip counter were used in the clean-state A/B. The third
  shimmer cleared before those comparisons, so they do not diagnose it.
  Evidence: both commits, `br2-external/package/taq102-diag/panel-trap` and
  the remaining panel/charging items in TODO.md. Automatic startup was not
  delivered with this instrumentation.
- [x] 2026-09-12 - **Desk: heartbeat implementation and measured RTT.** The
  dedicated heartbeat prevents an idle healthy link expiring while waiting
  for QLC+'s five-second websocket ping. Recorded 2744 samples over 30 min:
  p50 19 ms, p95 47 ms, p99 50 ms, max 319 ms, zero drops. Evidence:
  `docs/evidence/2026-09-12-desk-phase1/heartbeat-rtt-30min.log` identifies
  the old `deluxe-eventos` map with 1 of 11 controls enabled. This closes
  implementation/RTT only; the ten-minute untouched current-show scene
  acceptance has been restored to TODO.md as unverified.
- [x] 2026-09-12 - **Desk: the interface review, two rounds with the reviewer.**
  Every page and bank dumped from the tablet, six defects found by eye and
  fixed first: the master fader read `--` until somebody moved it on the Mac
  (`desk_add` starts every control unknown and the validator never set the
  slider's snapshot value), tiles cut by the panel's bottom edge
  (`CONTENT_END` was 600, not 584), a stray keyline on bright swatches (the
  RGB integer compared whole instead of its brightest channel), the link
  banner flipping words every 1.5 s, a 56 px gear, and the Wi-Fi join
  killing the supplicant's control socket: `RECONFIGURE` re-reads the file
  and forgets the `-O` override when the file names no `ctrl_interface`, so
  my tap on Join (17:01 UTC, seen in dmesg as a deauth by local
  choice) left `/var/run/wpa_supplicant` gone and every later request dead;
  `wifi_conf_write_block` now writes the line first, and the tablet was
  recovered with the line and a `SIGHUP`. A reviewer agent then found four
  capture defects (a second finger on the settings sheet ending the first's
  drag; the power key leaving slot bookkeeping stale; dead space on the
  speed page claiming the slot; a dead Scan alive to touch), fixed. the reviewer
  reviewed sixteen frames and the code (28 findings) and, after the round,
  the diff (10 more): applied in `84f828d`, `11d2070`, `3b9c962`, `291c513`:
  the panic button takes a second finger and ends the other's gesture, the
  lock and the gear cancel every capture including the rail's, tempo from
  the contact's timestamp with the echo deadline on the desk's clock, the
  state strip and the family's own automation on every bank, colours as
  clipped segments and names where there is no colour, a running choice on
  another bank named in the heading with an amber dot on its pill, whole
  bounds on the BPM steps, `Time x2` wording, a neutral palette in the
  settings (ink, never amber), a New key path for a known network whose old
  block comes back whole when the new key fails, checked address parsing
  with the keyboard staying open, an explicit Close, failure notes for the
  sweep and the saves, stale supplicant replies drained, another show said
  in a banner, the keyboard's `abc` and a hold-to-show. Evidence: the
  frames in `docs/evidence/2026-09-12-desk-review/`. Leftovers in `TODO.md`.
- [x] 2026-09-12 - **Desk, Phase 4: speed implementation.** The map's two dials (`Tempo Show`
  w34, five members; `Vel. Movimiento` w274, eighteen) parsed with their
  per-member multiplier enums; the engine's table mirrored (`speed_factor`:
  1/16 is 62 thousandths, None is a skipped field, Zero is zero); the codec
  decodes `w|SPEED_STATE|ms|enum` and encodes `SPEED_FACTOR`. A SPEED page as
  the rail's eighth entry with the compact state row and two cards: BPM large
  (`round(60000/ms)`), `563 ms  Time x1`, the member count; Tap (commits on
  the down edge, median of the last four intervals, 200 ms bounce, 2 s
  reset), -1/+1 BPM, x1/2, x2 and an explicit x1 (the way back from a None or
  Zero factor, which the engine multiplies by zero); `Tap both` sends up to
  two frames from one tap and is dead while either dial waits. One change
  outstanding per dial, same values never sent (the engine's setters return
  on equality and push nothing), an echo that matches clears it, any other
  push is adopted and noted `State updated` (the broadcast names no sender);
  1500 ms without an echo makes the dial unconfirmed and asks the session to
  re-read the console (`qlc_session_refresh`). Bounds 200..min(2000, timeMax)
  with steps past them dead, never clamped. the reviewer adjudicated six doubts
  (`docs/evidence/`), all adopted. On the
  tablet: the cards read 120 BPM off the snapshot, a probe's change on the
  Mac's side showed as 150 BPM with the note, and a run of taps on `Tap
  both` retimed both dials with the master's echo 39..179 ms after the
  touch-down, median 56 (`docs/evidence/2026-09-12-desk-phase4/`).
  Acceptance correction, 2026-09-13: these seven touch-to-ECHO samples have
  nearest-rank p95 179 ms. They miss 100 ms even as a proxy and are not the
  specified touch-to-DMX measurement; phase acceptance remains in TODO.md.
- [x] 2026-09-12 - **Desk, Phase 3: setup without ssh.** A gear at the left
  of the status bar opens a settings surface over the rail and content, the
  master column staying live. The Wi-Fi card talks to wpa_supplicant over its
  control socket (`wpa_ctrl`: request socket plus an attached event socket,
  no `wpa_cli`, no shell): a scan ends on `CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-RESULTS`, the
  table is parsed into one row per SSID with the strongest level and the
  security its flags declare (enterprise and WPA3-only rows are shown but not
  offered); a tap on a WPA row opens the on-screen keyboard (three layers,
  every printable ASCII character, masked with a `show` key, `done` dead
  under eight characters), a known or open row skips it, and a confirmation
  names what happens before one join action leaves the model. The join is a
  transaction (`wifi_join`): block written atomically into `/data/wifi.conf`
  with the next priority, `RECONFIGURE`, `SELECT_NETWORK` by the id
  `LIST_NETWORKS` gives, association awaited, the lease renewed by a fixed
  worker command, an address awaited; a wrong key, a refusal or twenty
  seconds of silence at any stage removes the block (a known network keeps
  its own), re-reads, and selects the previous network again. Proven against
  a fake supplicant in-process: success, wrong key with rollback, silence
  with rollback, a known block untouched by a failure. The master card runs
  the subnet sweep as a child of the desk itself (`dmxdesk --find
  192.168.1.71/24 9998`, prefix read off wlan0's netmask, batches of 64 with
  a 400 ms deadline, `GET /` and `QLC+` in the first 2 KB; on the tablet 2 s
  for a /24, both of this Mac's addresses listed), or takes an address typed
  on a keypad; either is saved to `/data/desk.conf` and the session re-dials
  at once (`--host` > the file > unconfigured, and the desk now starts
  without a master, the card saying so). Brightness is the desk's own
  (`desk_power` over the same `/data/taq102.conf` glcube keeps: fader 8..max,
  a deferred save, the battery policy behind a `Dim on battery` toggle).
  Passphrases: 8..63 printable ASCII, never in argv, logs or the map. On
  the tablet: the scan matched `wpa_cli scan_results`, the sweep listed this
  Mac and nothing dead, the desk linked from the file with no `--host`
  (`docs/evidence/2026-09-12-desk-phase3/`). Deviations from the plan: the
  gear is routed in `dmxdesk.c` rather than a `TARGET_GEAR` in `desk_input`;
  `control_runtime` was not reused (it drags the control centre's panel model
  and the Wi-Fi toggle worker along), `desk_power` carries the two things the
  desk needs. The finger checks (join, fader, toggle) are my, in
  `TODO.md`.
- [x] 2026-09-12 - **Desk, Phase 2: the pages.** Geometry left the controls
  for placements resolved per page and bank (`desk_layout_resolve`); seven
  pages on the rail with an ink marker; the room's states ride every page in
  a compact row; picks draw the colours their scenes write as swatch rings;
  captions wrap on two measured lines (no pick cut after the generator split
  the contrasts at their slash); bank pills where a page overflows (live 2,
  color 3, gobos 2); a lock target (tap locks, a held second unlocks, nothing
  counts until every finger lifts) and the power key (blanks and locks, wakes
  to locked) with show mode as the default. The perf gate failed at first
  (paint p50 217 ms) and passed after row-span rounded rectangles, a cached
  status bar, per-control damage with a clipped canvas and a presenter that
  copies only damage: paint p50 14 p95 16 ms, present p50 4 p95 5 ms, RSS
  8 MB (`docs/evidence/2026-09-12-desk-phase2/perf.txt`, with page frames
  dumped from the tablet). The show repository's full suite: 412 passed, 9
  skipped, 33 min.
- [x] 2026-09-12 - **Desk, Phase 0 and Phase 1.** Phase 0: the WebSocket
  client's pong buffer (`pong[4+125]` written with up to 131 bytes, a stack
  overflow on a 124/125-byte ping) fixed and tested; connect, handshake and
  the console fetch made non-blocking (`ws_client`, `http_fetch`, a bounded
  `send_queue`); the connect sequence a state machine (`qlc_session`) that
  reaches READY only on a fresh parsed snapshot, with every drop carrying its
  reason; the master unknown until its first push; the status bar in the
  desk's palette with an unknown battery drawn as such; the desk draws before
  it dials. On the tablet against QLC+ 5.2.2 (Vibra, port 9998): a 3 s frozen
  master dropped at 805 ms and relinked by itself; a dead host reported as
  `connect timeout` every ten seconds with the loop alive. The separate
  30-minute heartbeat log uses `deluxe-eventos`, 1 of 11 controls enabled,
  so it proves RTT, not a held Vibra scene. Its heartbeats: 2744 samples, p50 19 ms, p95 47, p99 50, max 319, zero drops
  (`docs/evidence/2026-09-12-desk-phase1/heartbeat-rtt-30min.log`).
  Phase 1: the reviewer found and the source confirmed that every generated solo
  frame carried `ExcludeMonitored=True`, so a pick never stopped the wheel
  AUTO started (5.2.2 `vcbutton.cpp:258`); fixed in qlctool for the seven
  handoff frames with a new check rule `marco solo sordo` and a dated
  regression; the three shows regenerated, validated headless and clean.
  `qlctool deskmap` now emits the tablet's map (132 controls, 7 pages, 2
  dials) and the desk reads schema 2, validates each control against the
  live console (widget, type, action, function, solo ancestry, QLC+ line)
  and lays out the room states with PARAR TODO under the master. Measured
  live through the probe (`handoff.txt` in the same evidence folder): AUTO
  starts 720/706/640; the Rig Rojo pick stops the wheel 706; CHARLA stops
  720 and 640 and releases the pick 727; PARAR TODO stops the rest. The
  hand-written June map and `tools/show-manifest.py` are gone.
- [x] 2026-09-11 - **Mainline: restrict the PCIe DMA write to PCIe.** Patch
  0019 changes the interface mask of the MAC 0x301 write in
  `trans_act_to_lps_8703b`, matching the sibling and vendor tables instead
  of touching PCIe DMA on SDIO. `8b45f35` records clean checkpatch and v86
  verification: interface down/up reassociates and obtains an address,
  warm reboot recovers Wi-Fi, no mac-power-on failure. Evidence:
  `kernel/mainline/0019-wifi-rtw88-8703b-stop-the-PCIe-DMA-write-reaching-SDI.patch`
  and `docs/evidence/2026-09-10-wifi/README.md`.
- [x] 2026-09-11 - **Mainline: submit Wi-Fi patches 0018 and 0019 upstream.**
  `2e8c06c` records the first submission; `d7450e9` corrects its delivery
  result. Six simultaneous list deferrals hit cPanel's five-deferral limit
  and discarded the first attempt. Sending the cover alone established the
  greylist entry; then both patches delivered to both lists and the maintainer,
  all three messages Completed, queue empty. Evidence: those commits and
  `kernel/mainline/README.md`, "Submitted upstream". Delivery is complete;
  upstream review/acceptance remains open.
- [x] 2026-09-11 - **Appliance: charger sleep and stable pickup arming.**
  `79eea3d` removes the battery-only sleep condition and requires three
  accelerometer samples within 60 mg to arm pickup. On v87, with a one-minute
  timer while plugged in, the tablet slept and stayed asleep four minutes,
  zero wake events in `/data/log/taq102-app.log`. The commit records 17/17
  control-centre host tests passing, including corrected touch-flip arguments.
  Evidence: `src/sleep_state.c`, the commit and README's sleep journal.
  Power-key wake still needs a hands-on check. The accompanying Vibra logo
  asset is decodable, but the v87 smudge/v88 palette work does not prove
  U-Boot rendering; that remains blocked in TODO.md.
- [x] 2026-09-10 - **Panel: package fliptest and correct the flicker metric.**
  `7c1bac5` adds fliptest to the five compiled diagnostics; v80 carries it.
  `tools/panel-camera/flicker.py` now separates fixed spatial banding from
  variation between frames. The measured moving component is 0.1-0.4% of
  mean, comparable to the bezel, with no distinction between static, every
  vblank and 100 ms flips; the backlight sweep showed no PWM signature.
  Evidence: the commit and `docs/evidence/2026-09-10-panel/README.md`.
  These clean-state measurements do not close the later intermittent shimmer.
- [x] 2026-09-10 - **Mainline:** 8 hour unattended soak of the cube on v85,
  clean. The check that matters is progress rather than liveness: the VOP
  interrupt advanced 168 counts in 3 s at the end, exactly the panel's 56 Hz.
  Wi-Fi stayed associated across the whole run, which is the charger and the
  rtw88 fix from the same night both holding. Battery reached 100 % and settled
  to a 13 mA trickle. No GPU hang, flip_done timeout or oops was recorded;
  the sole recurring rtw88 tx-report message appeared 11 times and remains
  its own backlog item. Duplicate active soak entry removed 2026-09-13.
- [x] 2026-09-10 - **Mainline:** the tablet discharged with the cable in,
  reporting `Charging` while `current_now` was -301 mA. The RK816's input limit
  sat at 450 mA because the charger driver takes that when the USB PHY's BC1.2
  detection reports neither SDP, CDP nor DCP -- and on this board it reports
  every cable as zero, `USB` included. The initial patch 0008 attempt used
  the board's DCP limit for an unknown port; the review below rejected that
  inference and the final policy keeps the driver conservative. From a
  clean boot on v85, brightness 255 with the cube running: +584 mA and the
  battery climbing, against -259 mA before. Measured along the way: the
  backlight costs about 300 mA and the cube 50 to 90.
  The first attempt made the driver guess -- it took the board's declared limit
  whenever detection said nothing -- and a the reviewer review rejected it: the binding
  defines that property as a dedicated charging port's maximum, and the branch
  also fired on an ordinary disconnect. The shipped fix instead holds an
  unclassified port to 450 mA and gives the usb supply a writable
  `input_current_limit`, which the appliance's `init` raises because it knows
  what it is plugged into. Two defects in the existing helper went with it: a
  request between 81 and 449 mA rounded up to 450, and the register write's
  error was discarded. Evidence, including the review:
  `docs/evidence/2026-09-10-charging/`.
- [x] 2026-09-10 — **Mainline:** the RTL8723CS warm-reboot wedge is fixed.
  Patch 0018 completes `trans_carddis_to_cardemu_8703b`, which never undid the
  12H LDO sleep (`0x23[4]`) and the SDIO suspend that
  `trans_cardemu_to_carddis_8703b` sets, so the WLAN MAC came back unpowered
  while the card still enumerated and `rtw_mac_power_on` waited forever for
  power ready. Found by diffing the vendor's tables against mainline's, entry
  by entry, after three other fixes failed on hardware (SDIO shutdown power-off,
  forced `pwr_off_seq` retry, `post-power-on-delay-ms`), all reverted. v79
  recovers a chip wedged by a loader-mode reboot on its first boot and survives
  repeated warm reboots. Also established on the way: no rail, GPIO or clock on
  this board can cut the chip's power, a cold power-off does not clear the
  wedge, and the chip itself is fine. Evidence:
  `docs/evidence/2026-09-10-wifi/` (16 files, including the the reviewer briefing and
  its answer); account in `README.md`.
- [-] 2026-09-09 - **Mainline: the v54 rescue and v55 beacon tasks are obsolete.**
  The white-screen recovery instructions and expiring scratch waiters described
  a past boot, not the running device. v59 booted on 2026-09-08 and v64-v66
  subsequently ran the cube; the repeated recovery/cube evidence is in
  `kernel/mainline/README.md` and `docs/evidence/2026-09-09-cube/`.
  Removed both obsolete entries and the old "mainline flash is not authorised"
  entry from the active backlog. Software loader entry and a vendor fallback
  are documented in README; no flashing is performed by this reconciliation.
- [-] 2026-09-09 - **Mainline: retire the old ramoops recovery race.**
  `7de354a` proved the RAM mailbox survives a warm reboot, but the button
  recovery cuts power and erases DRAM. Reading earlier after that recovery
  cannot retrieve the failed boot's log. `8c72a6a` then captured the actual
  genpd lock wait with the shell alive, in
  `docs/evidence/2026-09-08-mainline/genpd-deadlock-stack.txt`.
  The existing live built-in-boot trace / fw_devlink task owns the remaining
  deadlock work; the crash-dump task and its unexercised-rescue duplicate are
  removed from TODO.md.
- [x] 2026-09-09 — **Mainline:** touch works. The GSL3673 reports a
  1664x896 grid with X inverted; the DTS says so and glcube scales the
  declared range to the panel (v75, confirmed at the tablet; v74 had Y inverted
  from a corner test done with the tablet turned round). glcube also finds
  its input nodes by device name. Evidence: raw captures decoded in
  `kernel/mainline/FINDINGS.md`, "Touch works, once the geometry is told".
- [x] 2026-09-09 — **Mainline:** MAINTAINERS entry for `rk816_charger.c`
  (in 0008); the board DTS needs none, `get_maintainer.pl` already routes
  it to the ARM/Rockchip entry. Series re-verified: `git am` 17/17, tree
  equal to the VM's, `checkpatch --strict` clean bar the added-file
  reminder on 0017.
- [x] 2026-09-09 — **Mainline:** series taken through the tools. `checkpatch
  --strict`, `dt_binding_check` and `dtbs_check` (dtschema installed in the
  VM) found: no schema for the board compatible, forbidden reboot modes
  under the PMU, the D-PHY's extra clocks outside their binding, bindings
  inside driver patches, and four style nits. All fixed in the tree; the
  series is 17 `git am`-able patches reproducing it (0 diff lines); v72
  and v73 run it on the tablet. Left: the panel part number and MAINTAINERS.
- [x] 2026-09-09 — **Mainline:** patch series reviewed and rebuilt. Findings
  acted on: 0011 conflicted with 0007; no messages or Signed-off-by on most
  patches; PHY leak on the rk312x LVDS probe error paths; no DT binding for
  `rockchip,rk3126-lvds`; silead NAK tolerance unscoped; RK816 message
  stale and a division that could reach zero; stale numbering in README and
  config. Series is now `git format-patch` output, 12 patches, `git am`
  applies all twelve onto `28924df2a` and the tree equals the VM's (0 diff
  lines). v69 built from it runs on the tablet.
  - Evidence: `docs/evidence/2026-09-09-cube/v69-console-reviewed-series.log`.
- [x] 2026-09-09 — **Mainline:** the cube froze after 73 s on v66. lima's
  devfreq (`simple_ondemand`) drove the Mali from the bootloader's 148.5 MHz
  up to 480 MHz over the rk3128.dtsi OPP table with no regulator attached;
  150 transitions, then `pp0 job timeout` every 10 s and no reset recovered
  it. v67 deletes `operating-points-v2` from `&gpu`; 148.5 MHz, no devfreq,
  52.8 FPS, 0 timeouts at 2.5 min and at 23 min (soak sampled every
  5 min).
  - Evidence: `docs/evidence/2026-09-09-cube/v66-gpu-hang-devfreq-480mhz.txt`,
    `v67-console-no-devfreq.log`.
- [x] 2026-09-09 — **Mainline:** the cube runs. v66 boots Linux 7.3.0-rc2 and
  starts `glcube` by itself 14 s after power-on: Mesa 26.0.1 lima on the
  Mali-400 MP2, 1024x600, 52.8 FPS, `glGetError 0x0`.
  - Resolution: kernel = variant M unchanged; ramdisk gained `gpu-sched.ko`
    (the symbol lima was missing) and `taq102-cube`; board DTS gained
    `&gpu { status = "okay"; }` (rk3128.dtsi ships it disabled).
  - Evidence: `docs/evidence/2026-09-09-cube/`, images v64-v66 and
    `zImage-7.3.0-rc2-variant-M` in the archive with SHA256SUMS.
- [-] 2026-09-09 — **Mainline:** `GENPD_FLAG_NO_SYNC_STATE` as the narrow fix
  for the genpd deadlock. v63 (display stack built in plus that flag) hangs
  before userspace exactly like v62 without it. Superseded by the open item to
  trace a built-in boot; `fw_devlink=off` with the PHY as a module stays.
- [x] 2026-09-08 — **Mainline:** the panel works. Kernel console on the
  tablet's own screen at 1024x600, LVDS connector connected with the right
  physical size; two mainline bugs found (genpd deadlock, LVDS panel-bridge
  hijack), written up in `kernel/mainline/ISOLATING-THE-DISPLAY-HANG.md`.
- [x] 2026-09-08 — **Mainline:** Linux 7.3.0-rc2 boots on the tablet (v59):
  RK816 battery, eMMC and /data, rtw88 with a DHCP lease, USB ACM console.
  Evidence: `docs/evidence/2026-09-08-mainline/`.
- [x] 2026-09-08 — **Recovery:** the button dance landed after the v54 white
  screen, the BCB was zeroed and v49 came back with glcube running; the
  mainline crash log was not recovered (ramoops does not survive the power
  cycle the dance needs).
- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Appliance:** The status bar's battery and Wi-Fi icons were
  oversized and heavy, "nothing like iOS" in my words after v48.
  - Resolution: 5 by 11 units instead of 13 by 7, radius h/3, outline h/10,
    the Wi-Fi sector widened to 55 degrees each side with thinner arcs, gaps
    tightened, and the real systemGreen and systemRed
    (`src/statusbar.c`).
  - Evidence: photographed off the panel's own scanout before and after,
    `docs/evidence/2026-09-07-control-centre/statusbar-icons-before-after.png`;
    17 host tests pass; shipped as v49 (build `20260907-225750-25be25d`),
    written to `boot` and read back with SHA-256 matching.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Appliance:** The control centre's Wi-Fi tile, unseen on
  glass when v48 shipped.
  - Resolution: read off the panel's framebuffer with the control centre open.
    It shows `Wi-Fi`, `TestNet`, `192.168.1.51` and `-35 dBm`
    (`docs/evidence/2026-09-07-control-centre/panel-open-wifi-connected.png`).

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Bugs:** The control centre offered "Turn on" for a Wi-Fi
  that was already associated, and the tap that followed killed the Wi-Fi.
  `taq102-wifi up` and the app are both `::once` entries in inittab, so the
  runtime latched `wanted_wifi` from a status read taken before the link
  existed and never revised it. Tapping the wrong state ran `taq102-wifi up` a
  second time; `load()` returns early when `wlan0` exists, so a second
  `wpa_supplicant` started and the two reset each other's association for
  nearly two hours.
  - Fixes: `read_status` adopts an observed link as the wanted state except
    while an action of its own is in flight (`src/control_runtime.c`); `up`
    exits when the interface is already associated and addressed and otherwise
    clears leftovers first, and passes `-O /var/run/wpa_supplicant` because
    `wpa_passphrase` writes no `ctrl_interface=` line
    (`br2-external/package/taq102-wifi/taq102-wifi`); `read_wifi` ignores the
    -256 dBm an unassociated interface reports, which had been lighting a bar
    on a radio connected to nothing (`src/status.c`).
  - Evidence: the new case at `tests/control-centre/runtime_test.c:117` fails
    without the runtime fix and passes with it; 17 host tests pass. On the
    tablet, v48 (build `20260907-222214-8066348`) written to `boot` and read
    back byte for byte, SHA-256 matching, kernel and resource identical to
    v47. From a clean boot: Wi-Fi up by itself at 192.168.1.51, -35 dBm, one
    `wpa_supplicant`, one `udhcpc`, one `mdnsd`; a second `taq102-wifi up`
    answered "already associated and addressed" and left the count at one; and
    `taq102-wifi status` reached the daemon for the first time,
    `wpa_state=COMPLETED`.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Bugs:** the reviewer's review of the whole control-centre change
  (session `01a07d7f`) found three defects, fixed and shipped as v47: the
  rescue reboot skipped `sync()` (pending `/data` writes could be lost);
  the brightness sample was judged with the frame's timestamp, older than
  the sample's own, so the policy reset its window every time and Auto
  could stay at 255; and the touch decoder reset its slot to 0 on a flip or
  a cancel while the kernel kept slot 1, which could lose the first finger
  of a pinch.
  - Evidence: `test_slot_selection_survives_flip_and_cancel` in
    `tests/control-centre/touch_test.c`; 17 host tests pass; v47 (build
    `20260907-202158-bb04db0`) flashed to `boot` and `recovery`,
    readback-verified, 54.8 FPS from the clean boot, BCB zero.
  - Files: `src/reboot_target.c`, `src/control_runtime.c`, `src/touch_input.c`.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Appliance:** The control centre, the brightness policy,
  idle sleep with pick-up wake, and Inter on every screen (v46 in `boot` and
  `recovery`).
  - Result: spec `docs/journal.md`
    (reworked after a the reviewer review with ten blocking issues), plan
    `docs/journal.md`, twelve tasks;
    the reviewer implemented tasks 1 to 11 in five runs, each committed with its
    tests; new modules `font`, `canvas_blend`, `settings`, `backlight`,
    `power_policy`, `sleep_state`, `touch_input`, `touch_router`,
    `control_center` (model, layout, painter), `action_worker`,
    `wifi_status`, `reboot_target`, `touchsim`; `glcube.c` down to 627
    lines of wiring. Rescue backlight boots at 40.
  - Evidence: 17 host tests under ASan/UBSan pass
    (`tools/test-control-centre-host.sh`); the device test on the clean v46
    boot passes 22 of 22 (`docs/evidence/2026-09-07-control-centre/device-test-v46.log`,
    scanouts `open.png`, `mid-drag.png`, `armed.png`, four 60 s phases at
    54.8 FPS, zero GL errors); rescue round trip on v46: backlight 40 of
    255 logged by `/init`, battery +9 mA on the CDP port instead of -292,
    `rescue-screen text: Inter`, dump `rescue-v46-dump.png`, BCB zeroed and
    the appliance back at 54.8 FPS. Flashes readback-verified; images
    archived as `recovery-taq102-v46-*.img`.
  - Files: `src/`, `tests/control-centre/`, `tools/test-control-centre-*.sh`,
    `br2-external/package/taq102-fonts/`, `README.md` section "The control
    centre".

- [-] 2026-09-07 — **Pending decisions:** Backlight default.
  - Resolution: I wants it to adjust itself; the brightness
    controller and the manual slider replace a fixed default.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Kernel:** v44 and v45 flashed and proved: kernel with
  patches 0006 and 0007, the reset-pulse PHY module, and the new user space in
  `boot`; the matching stock-kernel rescue in `recovery`; BCB round trip done.
  - Result: v44 booted first with the old module still in `blobs/` (patch 0007
    absent), so `blobs/phy-rockchip-inno-video-combo-phy-4.4.167.ko` was
    replaced by the v44 build (md5 `0739dbab`) and v45 packed and flashed.
    From a clean v45 boot: build `20260907-162319-23127e9`, `4.4.167`, module
    md5 on the tablet `0739dbab`, PHY registers `REG03=0x02 REG04=0x1C`
    (336 MHz), `REG00=0x7D REG01=0xE0 E4=0xAA` (analog on, defaults after the
    reset pulse), LVDS bound at 4.40 s, glcube 54.8 FPS, `CDP1.5A input=1500`
    kept; fb blank/unblank cycle drops and restores the GSL3673 reset pin and
    the chip answers with the IRQ count climbing 6 to 13. Round trip:
    `boot-recovery` at raw sector 32800, rescue up on 4.4.103 with the screen
    turned by the sensor (y 943 mg), zeroed, appliance back. Camera:
    `docs/evidence/2026-09-07/`. Both flashes readback-verified; the `boot`
    write used `tools/flash-boot.sh`, `recovery` used the new `--no-bcb` mode;
    `tablet.sh reboot-loader` returned in 0.75 s and the loader appeared 4 s
    later (the 2026-09-03 hang is gone). The webcam renders the rescue
    screen as a green-to-pink gradient under BOTH kernels while the scanout
    buffer under ours measures amber and opaque, so the gradient is panel
    angle plus camera, not the VOP; my eyes are the final word.
    Images archived in
    the archive disk[45]-*.img`.
  - Files: `blobs/`, `br2-external/`, `log/v44/` (untracked artifacts).

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Integrations:** The tablet answers to `taq102.local`:
  hostname set in `/init`, sent to DHCP as option 12, and `mdnsd` (Buildroot
  package, SSH service) started on `wlan0` once the lease is in.
  - Evidence: `dns-sd -G v4 taq102.local` on the Mac returns 192.168.1.57
    within a second on both the appliance and the rescue; ssh by that name
    used for every check after the flash.
  - Files: `br2-external/configs/taq102_defconfig`,
    `br2-external/package/taq102-wifi/taq102-wifi`,
    `br2-external/board/taq102/rootfs-overlay/init`.

- [-] 2026-09-07 — **Security:** Rotate the Wi-Fi key exposed in a 2026-09-02
  transcript.
  - Resolution: accepted (home network, private transcript).

- [-] 2026-09-07 — **Pending decisions:** Mainline track or appliance polish.
  - Resolution: left to the run; the appliance goes first (the
    control centre, brightness policy, sleep). Mainline stays a future idea.

- [-] 2026-09-07 — **Infrastructure:** Raise the build VM's memory.
  - Resolution: left to the run. OrbStack gives 8 GB overall on a
    16 GB Mac; a full `make` passed at that size on 2026-09-07 with `kbuild`
    stopped, so nothing is raised. Keep `kbuild` stopped while building.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Bugs:** the reviewer review of the run (session `01a07c22`)
  found two regressions of mine, both fixed: glcube's bar canvas was reused
  without clearing, so the new composite kept old digits (778 stale pixels
  on a repaint from 87% charging to 12%); it is now cleared before each
  paint. `measure.sh` used an `mktemp` template with a suffix, which macOS
  takes literally, so a second run with the same tag failed; it now makes a
  unique directory.
  - Evidence: host test linking `src/statusbar.c` and `src/canvas.c`: repaint
    versus fresh 0 differing pixels, rescue bar rows 0 alpha-0 pixels; glcube
    rebuilt after `tools/vm-hash-check.sh` caught a stale mount once, deployed,
    54.8 FPS; `mktemp -d` twice with the same template gave two directories.
  - Files: `src/glcube.c`, `tools/panel-camera/measure.sh`.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Kernel:** Patch series reconciled: `0001` had absorbed
  `0002`'s two analog-power hunks, so a fresh checkout could not take the
  series in order. `0001` regenerated as the tree minus `0007` minus `0002`.
  - Evidence: in the VM, pristine `HEAD` file + `0001` + `0002` + `0007`
    is byte-identical (`cmp`) to the driver the kernel is built from; before,
    `0002` reported "2 out of 2 hunks ignored". README's stale
    `0001-video-combo-phy-enable-h2p-clock.patch` name corrected.
  - Files: `kernel/patches/0001-video-combo-phy-clocks-and-pll.patch`, `README.md`.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Kernel:** Backlog run, wave 3 (the reviewer, session
  `01a07c17`): patches 0006 (GSL3673 releases slots 0..10 on suspend and
  resume) and 0007 (combo PHY pulses its reset at power-on) written, applied
  to the VM tree, built and staged; NOT flashed.
  - Evidence: `tools/build-kernel.sh` from `/work/kernel-v40.config` with the
    hybrid DTS ended with `zImage is ready`, no `error:`; the PHY module
    relinked with vermagic `4.4.167 SMP preempt mod_unload modversions ARMv7
    p2v8`; both patches apply in reverse with zero fuzz; `log/kernel-v44/`
    holds the three artifacts, `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` OK on the Mac.
    the reviewer's brief had the slot bound wrong (0..9); corrected to 0..10 after
    reading `input_mt_init_slots(MAX_CONTACTS + 1)`, rebuilt.
  - Files: `kernel/patches/0006-*.patch`, `kernel/patches/0007-*.patch`.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Infrastructure:** `tools/vm-hash-check.sh` compares the
  tracked sources on the Mac and through the VM's mount before a build; the
  README build notes name `<pkg>-dirclean` as the resync.
  - Evidence: `tools/vm-hash-check.sh` run against `src` and `br2-external`
    (result in the run report).

- [-] 2026-09-07 — **Kernel:** Put the touch panel's `screen_max_x/y` in the
  hybrid device tree.
  - Resolution: the GSL3673 driver never reads them (only compile-time
    `SCREEN_MAX_*` variants in `gsl3673.h`); the 2048x1536 range is the
    driver's, and `src/touch_flip.c` mapping by the KMS mode is the fix.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Bugs:** The rescue screen was washed out under the
  stock kernel: the status bar's downsample rewrote every pixel of the canvas
  it was given, and outside the bar the source is all alpha 0, so the amber
  background came back as transparent black (since the supersampling of
  2026-09-04; the v43 round-trip photo shows it). `statusbar_paint` now
  composites only the bar's rows over the canvas with straight-alpha "over",
  which leaves glcube's transparent bar canvas exactly as before.
  - Evidence: rescue-screen deployed live on the tablet, `/dev/mem` scanout
    read: 614,400 of 614,400 pixels at alpha 255, 504,273 amber, 47 distinct
    colours in the bar rows; glcube redeployed, 54.8 FPS. Found by the reviewer in
    the wave-2 run.
  - Files: `src/statusbar.c`.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Appliance:** Backlog run, wave 2 (the reviewer, session
  `01a07c06`): rescue screen rotates with the accelerometer (`RESCUE_FLIP=0|1`
  override), `RESCUE_DUMP` refuses symlinks, `glcube` and `rescue-screen` take
  DRM master explicitly and exit when refused, `particles` paints opaque
  pixels, BusyBox gains `timeout`, `taq102-app` logs to `/data/log`.
  - Evidence: cross-built in the VM with no new warnings; deployed live to the
    tablet's tmpfs with hash checks: second `glcube` exits with
    `drmSetMaster: Invalid argument` while the first keeps 54.8 FPS; with
    fixed telemetry the `RESCUE_FLIP=1` dump equals the `RESCUE_FLIP=0` dump
    rotated a half turn at every pixel, and the unforced run equals the
    flipped one because the sensor reads Y +989 mg; `/dev/mem` scanout of the
    new `particles` has 614,400 of 614,400 pixels at alpha 255; the new
    busybox lists `timeout` and `timeout 1 sleep 5` exits 143; the new
    supervisor wrote 54.8 FPS lines to `/data/log/taq102-app.log`. Appliance
    restored at 54.8 FPS. Full record: the reviewer `FINDINGS-A.md` of the run.
  - Files: `src/rescue-screen.c`, `src/glcube.c`, `src/particles.c`,
    `br2-external/package/rescue-screen/rescue-screen.mk`,
    `br2-external/configs/taq102_defconfig`,
    `br2-external/board/taq102/busybox.fragment`,
    `br2-external/board/taq102/rootfs-overlay/usr/bin/taq102-app`.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Infrastructure:** Backlog run, wave 1: repo-only items.
  - Result: `get-rkdeveloptool.sh` pinned to `304f073` and `get-mkbootimg.sh`
    to `d2bb0af`; `flash-recovery.sh` gained `--no-bcb` and both flash scripts
    default to `tools/vendor/rkdeveloptool`; `measure.sh` uses `mktemp`;
    the shimmer instruments (`zigzag.py`, `shift.py`, `sweep.sh`, `wobble.sh`,
    `src/bartest.c`) moved out of the session scratchpad into
    `tools/panel-camera/` with portable paths, `sweep.sh` recording the iPhone
    device and crop; `taq102-app` comment names the measured `KEY_BACK`.
  - Evidence: `sh -n` clean on every script; `tools/flash-recovery.sh --no-bcb`
    prints usage and finds the vendor binary (`rkdeveloptool ld` ran).
  - Files: `tools/get-rkdeveloptool.sh`, `tools/get-mkbootimg.sh`,
    `tools/flash-recovery.sh`, `tools/panel-camera/*`, `src/bartest.c`.

- [x] 2026-09-07 — **Documentation:** README "Status" points at the current
  state; the first DTS's bus-format comment corrected and the file marked
  superseded; the 2026-09-01 the reviewer research archived in `docs/research/`;
  the brain page's "Still open" list drops the two settled questions.
  - Evidence: `docs/research/2026-09-01-the review-route-findings.md` (607 lines,
    from the archive disk); brain commit `e79d20d9`, pushed.

- [x] 2026-09-06 — **Documentation:** The two 2026-09-04 the reviewer runs' findings
  archived with the evidence.
  - Evidence: commit `52de391`; `docs/evidence/2026-09-05/the review-findings-1-blackframes-touch.md`,
    `the review-findings-2-lvds-variants.md`.

- [x] 2026-09-05 — **Infrastructure:** v43: the diagnostics ship in the image
  and `recovery` holds the matching stock-kernel rescue, proved by a BCB round trip.
  - Result: `package/taq102-diag` (`testpattern`, `phytune`, `lvdsdiag`);
    `recovery` written with `rkdeveloptool wl 196608` and read back byte for
    byte; `boot-recovery` at raw sector 32800, rescue up on 4.4.103 with Wi-Fi
    and ssh, sector zeroed, appliance back at 336 MHz.
  - Evidence: commits `c0c9b28`, `6514c1a`; `docs/evidence/2026-09-05/rescue-v43-round-trip.jpg`.

- [x] 2026-09-05 — **Kernel:** The shimmer was the LVDS PHY PLL's jitter; the
  vendor divider pair fixes it (v42).
  - Result: `prediv 2 / fbdiv 28` = 336 MHz instead of `12 / 175` = 350 MHz;
    picture movement 0.005 px rms against 0.63-0.81, 0.06 from a cold boot.
    A stray `REGE4 = 0x80` write living only in the VM tree was removed and
    patch 0001 matches the tree again. The "7x pixel clock" rule was measured
    with the panel unpowered and is retired.
  - Evidence: commit `192cde9`; `docs/evidence/2026-09-05/vlines-*.png`;
    `src/testpattern.c`, `src/phytune.c`, `src/lvdsdiag.c`.

- [-] 2026-09-05 — **Kernel:** "The serial clock must be 7x the pixel clock"
  (350 MHz, prediv 12).
  - Resolution: measured with LDO6 off; superseded by the vendor's 336 MHz
    pair, which drives the panel with a hundredfold less jitter.

- [x] 2026-09-04 — **Backend:** the reviewer runs: accelerometer read moved off the
  render thread (the black flashes), touch flip mapped to the KMS mode with
  `GLCUBE_TOUCH_FLIP`, `lvdsdiag` variant harness.
  - Evidence: `src/accel_monitor.c`, `src/touch_flip.c`, `src/lvdsdiag.c`;
    findings in `docs/evidence/2026-09-05/`.

- [x] 2026-09-04 — **Appliance:** Wobble fixed and the tablet knows which way
  up it is (v41).
  - Result: the resting spin's 0.84 s kick is held constant; the i2c-2 0x18
    sensor is a Silan SC7A20, driven by `src/accel.c`, and glcube flips
    picture, bar and touch on Y gravity; status-bar margin, bolt, supersampling.
  - Evidence: commit `444cf39`; confirmed wobble, orientation and bar
    2026-09-05.

- [x] 2026-09-04 — **Bugs:** Touch alive on the own kernel, cube no longer
  freezes (v40).
  - Result: fbcon's `consoleblank=600` reset the GSL3673 through the fb-blank
    notifier (`taq102-app` unbinds fbcon); the vendor tree's `gsl3673.h` was
    another panel's firmware (patch 0005 installs the stock arrays); a slot
    silent for 0.5 s counts as lifted; KEY_POWER sleep/wake; status bar in glcube.
  - Evidence: commit `242e478`; GSL IRQ count climbing on `/proc/interrupts`;
    confirmed touch, button and no flicker 2026-09-04 17:25.

- [x] 2026-09-04 — **Kernel:** Charger limit kept on DC detect (patch 0004, v38).
  - Result: rk816's DC-detect path no longer overwrites the USB detection's
    1500 mA with 450 mA; +584 mA at brightness 255 from power-on.
  - Evidence: `kernel/patches/0004-rk816-battery-keep-usb-input-limit-on-dc-detect.patch`.

- [x] 2026-09-04 — **Kernel:** Flicker root-caused to the VOP's IOMMU; dropped
  (v37).
  - Result: `fliptest` split the flip path from the content (two identical
    buffers flicker, the same buffer does not); `iommus` removed from the vop
    node, CMA buffers at 0x88600000, 54.8 FPS kept. Mainline's rk3128.dtsi has
    no VOP IOMMU either (Alex Bee, LKML 2023-12-16: silicon bug).
  - Evidence: `src/fliptest.c`; `tools/make-hybrid-dts.py` graft 7;
    `kernel/rk3126-taq102-hybrid.dts`.

- [x] 2026-09-04 — **Appliance:** Rescue screen shows battery and Wi-Fi (v35),
  then an iOS-style status bar (v39); glcube keeps a resting spin (v36).
  - Result: the Mac's USB port drains the tablet at brightness 255 (`NONE
    USB` 450 mA) and a USB-C hub charges it (`CDP1.5A`); the start-up spin was
    coasting to a stop in 5 s.
  - Evidence: commits `c50d311`, `70968c1`; `docs/evidence/2026-09-04/`;
    `RESCUE_DUMP` frame.

- [x] 2026-09-03 — **Appliance:** Rescue has a face (v34).
  - Result: `rescue-screen` paints RESCUE MODE, kernel, build id and address
    from a DRM dumb buffer; the stock VOP blends XRGB as ARGB (alpha 0xFF); the
    stock kernel's first modeset is blank, so the CRTC is cycled once.
  - Evidence: commit `8fa9f47`; `docs/evidence/2026-09-03/camera/2026-09-03-v34-*.jpg`.

- [x] 2026-09-03 — **Infrastructure:** The appliance runs on the own kernel
  (v31) and `recovery` holds a real stock-kernel rescue, round trip measured.
  - Result: `taq102-display` loads the PHY module from `/init`; `taq102-app`
    waits for `/dev/dri/card0`; cube at 5.10 s from power-on. v18 had been our
    own kernel without the PHY, a blind rescue. `flash-recovery.sh` verifies by
    readback before writing the BCB. The volume button does not boot
    `recovery`; it trips the autostart hatch (`KEY_BACK`).
  - Evidence: `docs/evidence/2026-09-03/camera/2026-09-03-v30-appliance-boot.jpg`,
    `2026-09-03-recovery-stockkernel.jpg`.

- [x] 2026-09-03 — **Kernel:** The panel had no power: RK816 LDO6 was switched
  off by the regulator core (the stock kernel's disable fails and that is what
  kept it alive); then the first modeset left GPIO2_B4 low (patch 0003). v29
  passes from a clean boot.
  - Result: `regulator-always-on` grafted on `LDO_REG6`; loader-protect off
    path resets the panel state. Every earlier negative result was taken with
    the rail off. A truncated `orb cat` zImage cost one dark boot;
    `tools/pull-kernel.sh` hashes the copy.
  - Evidence: `docs/evidence/2026-09-03/snapshot-*`, `2026-09-03-gpio2-trace-v28-first-modeset.txt`,
    `camera/2026-09-03-v29-boot.jpg`; `kernel/patches/0003-*`.

- [x] 2026-09-03 — **Testing:** A camera closed the measurement loop and the
  panel was proved good.
  - Result: `tools/panel-camera/` (brightness and frame-to-frame motion,
    calibrated: off 33.7, on 104-118, floor 0.74-1.06); forcing the VOP to
    black left the panel white (deaf, not confused); flashing `boot-taq102-v14.img`
    back put the cube on the same panel, refuting the reviewer's hardware conclusion.
    Two real PHY defects found and kept (patch 0002, E4 common mode), neither
    the cause.
  - Evidence: commits `ee3f808`, `c3ca569`; `docs/evidence/`;
    `camera/v14-look.jpg`.

- [x] 2026-09-03 — **Kernel:** The 4.4.167 kernel builds and boots; the display
  comes up on it.
  - Result: `tools/build-kernel.sh` captures the seven host breakages; the
    non-boot was a malformed RSCE resource blob (`tools/make-resource.py`
    reproduces the stock image byte for byte); PHY `-19` then `-517` fixed by
    `CONFIG_PHY_ROCKCHIP_INNO_VIDEO_COMBO_PHY` as a module; the PWM pinctrl
    state must be named `active`; `tools/make-hybrid-dts.py` reproduces the
    tested blob. `/dev/dri/card0`, `LVDS-1` at 1024x600@56.14, glcube 54.8 FPS.
  - Evidence: commits `4281d04`, `9fd1b3f`, `cfd735a`, `5deda33`;
    `kernel/patches/0001-*`.

- [-] 2026-09-03 — **Kernel:** Hardware fault in the flex, connector or TCON
  (the reviewer round 2).
  - Resolution: refuted by the v14 control run on the same panel; the cause
    was LDO6.

- [-] 2026-09-03 — **Kernel:** The rebuilt PHY module "will not load" (`invalid
  module format`).
  - Resolution: a zero-byte file on the tablet; every copy now checks size and hash.

- [-] 2026-09-03 — **Kernel:** Capture U-Boot's live PHY registers before the
  kernel reprograms them.
  - Resolution: with no driver claiming the block it stays clock-gated and
    reads as zeroes; superseded by instrumenting the running kernel.

- [-] 2026-09-03 — **Kernel:** "The own-built 4.4.167 kernel never boots."
  - Resolution: it always did; the non-boot was the malformed resource blob and
    the missing console.

- [x] 2026-09-02 — **Infrastructure:** A logo is not a brick; host tools
  scripted.
  - Result: the tablet sat at the Denver logo because the BCB still said
    `boot-recovery` and `recovery` held a non-booting image; zeroing sector
    24608 brought it back. `tools/get-rkdeveloptool.sh`, `tools/get-mkbootimg.sh`,
    and a watcher polling `rkdeveloptool ld` once a second.
  - Evidence: commit `4281d04`; README "Two images, and how to get a console".

- [x] 2026-09-02 — **Backend:** SSH over Wi-Fi, key-only, keys on `/data`;
  reflashing through `reboot-loader` needs neither serial nor Android.
  - Evidence: commit `5df0c6a`; `br2-external/package/taq102-ssh`.

- [x] 2026-09-02 — **Frontend:** Gestures: arcball rotation with quaternion
  momentum, 1€ filter, two-finger zoom, drag and twist; four multitouch bugs
  from trusting slot state.
  - Evidence: commit `4a77073`; `src/arcball.c`, `src/oneeuro.c`; README "The
    gestures, and the four ways they were wrong".

- [x] 2026-09-02 — **Backend:** Wi-Fi up with the vendor `8723cs.ko` under the
  stock kernel; MAC pinned in `/data/wifi.mac` because `rk_vendor_read` fails.
  - Evidence: commit `85e5e13`; ping 1.1.1.1 in 20 ms, HTTP fetched;
    `blobs/8723cs-4.4.103.ko`.

- [x] 2026-09-02 — **Database:** Android erased; `userdata` (55 GB) is ext4 at
  `/data`, found by start sector 4867072, persistence verified over two reboots.
  - Result: all eleven partition backups checksum-verified first; 20 KB of
    `trust` had been zeroed by addressing a partition by number and was
    restored byte for byte (`PARTITION-NUMBERING-WARNING.md` on the archive).
  - Evidence: commits `28906c0`, `d0bc88f`.

- [x] 2026-09-02 — **Backend:** Mali-400 up with the r7p0 GBM blob (glibc,
  openssl for six RSA/BN symbols, no SONAME); `glcube` at 54.3 FPS on the
  56.14 Hz panel.
  - Evidence: commit `d34eb9e`; `br2-external/package/mali-utgard`.

- [x] 2026-09-02 — **Infrastructure:** Our own system boots from `boot` with
  `recovery` as the fallback; autostart at boot, backlight 255, rescue variant.
  - Result: BCB lives at `misc` + 16 KB (LBA 24608), not AOSP offset 0;
    nothing may boot Android between a recovery flash and its boot
    (`install-recovery.sh` restores stock). USB ACM console 2.68 s after
    kernel start.
  - Evidence: commits `3c7ca78`, `8cb318b`; README "Where the image lives now".

- [x] 2026-09-02 — **Frontend:** `particles`: a KMS particle field, 6000 of
  them at the panel's 56 Hz, tear-free; the musl 64-bit `time_t` made
  `struct input_event` 24 bytes against the kernel's 16 and ate every touch.
  - Evidence: commits "particles: ..." (2026-09-02); `src/particles.c`.

- [x] 2026-09-02 — **Infrastructure:** The image builds: Buildroot 2026.02.3,
  headers pinned to 4.4, Ubuntu 26.04's `uutils` and C23's `constexpr` worked
  around, cross-built in the OrbStack machine `taq102`.
  - Evidence: first three commits; `br2-external/configs/taq102_defconfig`.

- [-] 2026-09-02 — **Infrastructure:** An SD rescue card (idbloader + miniloader
  + our system) to recover the dark tablet.
  - Resolution: superseded by loader mode plus the BCB at LBA 24608, and by
    `reboot-loader` from the running system; the card was never finished.

- [-] 2026-09-02 — **Infrastructure:** The volume-button combination boots
  `recovery`.
  - Resolution: the tablet has two buttons; the combination reaches loader
    mode, the single button trips the autostart hatch. The paths are software.

- [x] 2026-09-01 — **Documentation:** Hardware identified and backed up; route
  settled.
  - Result: RK3126C on a BND-RK3126C-D708 board, Android 8.1, kernel 4.4.103,
    GSL3673, RK816, RTL8723CS; full eMMC image and 16 partition dumps,
    sha256-verified; GSL3673 firmware extracted from the stock kernel. Route:
    keep the stock boot chain, replace only the recovery ramdisk with a
    Buildroot userspace (the reviewer, two rounds).
  - Evidence: the archive disk and
    `research/FINDINGS.md`; the knowledge base.

- [-] 2026-09-01 — **Infrastructure:** Replace U-Boot, and mainline first.
  - Resolution: never needed; the stock boot chain stays and the recovery
    ramdisk is ours. Mainline is the later track (see `TODO.md`).

- [-] 2026-09-01 — **Documentation:** the reviewer round 3 ("console without UART, what
  must be captured now").
  - Resolution: never answered (model at capacity); answered in practice by the
    USB ACM gadget console the next day.
