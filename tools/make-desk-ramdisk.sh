# Usage: tools/make-desk-ramdisk.sh <base.cpio.gz> <out.cpio.gz>
# Inject the desk into an existing mainline ramdisk; refuse to overwrite output.
# Build output/dmxdesk if absent (run tools/build-dmxdesk.sh first to refresh an
# existing binary). Keep the base archive byte-for-byte, append a root-owned
# newc overlay, then gzip the combined archives in ONE stream. This preserves
# every unrelated file, mode, symlink, device node, module and the diagnostic
# /init. No extraction or privileged filesystem writes are needed on the host.
# Requires Python 3, cpio with -R uid:gid support, gzip, and git.
